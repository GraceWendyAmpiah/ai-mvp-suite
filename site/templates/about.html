      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a recent graduate of Aerospace Engineering from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), 
        with a deep-rooted passion for technology, creativity, and problem-solving. I believe in action and execution—no 
        matter how limited the resources, something tangible can always be built.
      </p>
      <p>
        I operate from the conviction that knowledge is everywhere, and if you leverage the tools available at your 
        fingertips, you can bring powerful ideas into reality.

      <h2>My Approach</h2>
      <p>
        My approach is hands-on, fast-moving, and impact-driven. I enjoy building systems that directly benefit people 
        in my local context—especially tools that use technology to simplify daily life in Ghana. From AI-powered mobile 
        services to tools for detecting fraud and misinformation, my work always aims to bridge the gap between high-tech 
        possibilities and real-world needs.

      <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
      <p>
        As an upcoming software developer, I am delivery-focused, agile, and relentlessly curious. I pride myself on 
        rapidly acquiring the skills I need to solve problems, and I'm intentional about learning the principles of 
        clean code, maintainable project design, and scalable systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        My strength lies not just in coding, but in executing ideas that work, adapting quickly, and delivering tangible 
        results under pressure. This portfolio showcases MVPs that solve real, local problems using resourceful tools, 
        open-source libraries, and pure determination.
